#### Current Features

* Difficulty Levels
* Single Player Mode
* High Score

#### Future Improvements:

* In Version 2 of this game I would like to modify the layout of the game to more resemble the look of the handheld game. I would design Simon into a circle with seperate color quarters.

* I would also like to have the screen fade away once the high score has been reached and the player's name and high score be displayed for a certain period of time.
